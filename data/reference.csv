Missouri Plan/Merit Selection,The governor appoints a judge from a nominating commission's suggestions. Sitting judges run for additional terms in retention elections.,"<strong>Missouri Plan/Merit Selection:</strong> A judicial selection model which combines certain elements of appointment- and election-based selection methods. Under the Missouri Plan, first adopted by its namesake state, judicial vacancies are filled by the governor, who appoints a judge from a slate of candidates selected by a nominating commission. Sitting judges approaching the end of their terms may seek additional terms through standing in an unopposed yes/no retention election.",Missouri Plan/Merit Selection
Nominating Commission,An independent commission evaluates candidates and forwards a list of those deemed most-qualified to the appointing authority,"<strong>Judicial Nominating Commission:</strong> Many states that appoint judges enlist a nominating commission to evaluate candidates for a judicial vacancy. The commission forwards a short list of candidates it finds most qualified to the appointing authority. Judicial nominating commissions vary widely in their size, composition, and power. Commissioners—who can be lawyers or non-lawyers—are typically appointed by the state’s legislative and executive leaders, and the state bar association also often appoints or nominates members. A commission’s suggestions can be binding, meaning the appointing authority’s selection must come from the commission’s list, or nonbinding, in which case the authority may select from the commission’s list but is not required to do so.",Nominating Commission

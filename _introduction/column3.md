**How Do I Use the Map?** Use the two dropdown menus to view selection processes for a given court level and selection phase, or select “Overview” for a general summary of how each state selects its judges. 

Click to interact directly with the map and legend. Hover over any colored bar for a glance at the states included in that category, and click to highlight that group of states in the map. Groups with a (+) symbol expand with a click to display additional detail. To learn more about a particular state, select it on the map or in the menu below. Hover over a confusing term for a brief definition or check out the [glossary of terms](https://www.brennancenter.org/rethinking-judicial-selection/glossary){:target="_blank"} for a more in-depth explanation.

<b>Why State Courts?</b>
Each day, state court judges shape the country we live in. They interpret the law to resolve disagreements and protect the rights of people in the communities they serve. Yet in spite of their consistent importance state court judges are selected differently in nearly every state. The Brennan Center produced this interactive map to describe, compare, and evaluate selection processes across the country, and to help foster conversations about how those methods might be improved.

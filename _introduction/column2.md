<b>Judicial Selection is Complex.</b>
States select judges differently depending on both the level of state court and what type of judicial vacancy is being filled. Each state has several levels of courts, ranging from the trial court level to the state supreme court level. The type of vacancy, or “Phase” of selection, depends on when the seat becomes open and whether it involves an incumbent judge seeking re-selection for an additional term on the court.

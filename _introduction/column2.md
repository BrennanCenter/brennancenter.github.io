States select judges differently depending on both the level of state court and
what type of judicial vacancy is being filled. Each state has several levels of
courts, ranging from the trial court level to the state supreme court level. The
 type of vacancy, or “selection phase,” depends on when the seat becomes open
 and whether it involves an incumbent judge seeking re-selection for an
 additional term on the court. Use the two dropdown menus to view selection
 processes for a given court level and selection phase, or select “Overview”
 for a general summary of how each state selects its judges.
